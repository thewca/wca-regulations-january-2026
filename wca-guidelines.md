# <wca-title>WCA Guidelines

<version>Version: January 1, 2025


## Notes

### WCA Regulations

The WCA Guidelines supplement the [WCA Regulations](regulations:top). Please see the Regulations for more information about the WCA.

### Numbering

Guidelines are numbered in correspondence with related regulations. Note that multiple Guidelines may correspond to the same Regulation, and some Guidelines correspond to Regulations that do not exist anymore.

### Labels

To be more informative, each Guideline is classified using one of the following labels. Note that this should be treated as metadata, not as a description of importance.

- <label>[ADDITION] Additional information to supplement the Regulations.
- <label>[CLARIFICATION] Information to address any possible questions about the interpretation of the Regulations.
- <label>[EXPLANATION] Information that clarifies the intent of Regulations.
- <label>[RECOMMENDATION] Something that is not strictly mandatory, but that should be done if possible.
- <label>[REMINDER] Information that may be addressed by other Regulations/Guideline, but whose relevance is worth reiterating.
- <label>[EXAMPLE] An example of how to apply a Regulation.


## <contents> [Contents](guidelines:contents)

<table-of-contents>


## <article-1><officials><officials> Article 1: Officials

- 1c+) [CLARIFICATION] If there are multiple WCA Delegates designated for the competition, "the WCA Delegate" refers to any of them. "The WCA Delegate" also refers to anyone appointed by a designated WCA Delegate for a relevant responsibility of the WCA Delegate for the competition.
- 1c++) [CLARIFICATION] WCA Delegates may attend the competition without being designated to serve in the WCA Delegate role for the competition. "The WCA Delegate" does not refer to them unless they have been appointed with a relevant responsibility by a designated WCA Delegate for the competition (see [Guideline 1c+](guidelines:guideline:1c+)).
- 1h+) [RECOMMENDATION] Competitors in the same group should use the same scramble sequences. Different groups should use different scramble sequences.
- 1h++) [RECOMMENDATION] All attempts in the final round of an event, as well as all 3x3x3 Fewest Moves attempts, should have the same scramble sequences for all competitors (i.e. only 1 group).
- 1h+++) [ADDITION] Competitors may request to compete at a time different to the scheduled time for the round in a separate group. The WCA Delegate should carefully consider the fairness and practicality of the situation before approving any such requests, and must ensure that such attempts follow [Regulation 9l](regulations:regulation:9l) (i.e. they must start after all competitors have finished their attempts from any previous round of the same event, and finish before any competitor has started an attempt for any following round of the same event). Competitors requesting such accommodations should contact the organization team and WCA Delegate before the competition. Exception: such accommodations are not permitted for 3x3x3 Fewest Moves, which specifies its own limited accommodations in [Guideline E2b++](guidelines:guideline:E2b++).
- 1h1a+) [CLARIFICATION] Judges who are competing in a 3x3x3 Fewest Moves attempt they are judging must not begin grading attempts until they have finished their own attempt. They may begin grading before the end of the 60 minutes if they have submitted their attempt early (see [Guideline E2b+](guidelines:guideline:E2b+)). They should get another judge to grade their own attempt.


## <article-2><competitors><competitors> Article 2: Competitors

- 2c+) [ADDITION] First-time competitors must register using their legal name or the name they prefer to be called in real life. Last names must be legal last names.
- 2c2+) [CLARIFICATION] A WCA profile is the collection of data related to a competitor, and includes their personal information (name, country, gender, and date of birth) as well as all their results in official WCA competitions.
- 2d+) [ADDITION] Date of birth and contact information should be especially secured.
- 2d++) [REMINDER] If a third party (e.g. journalist) asks the organization team to be put in contact with any competitor(s), the competitor(s) must first be asked for consent.
- 2e+) [CLARIFICATION] If a competitor holds multiple citizenships, they may choose which region to represent at their first competition.
- 2e++) [ADDITION] The WCA Delegate should also verify the name and date of birth by means of documents or photos of documents (e.g. a passport) of every new competitor at their first competition.
- 2e3+) [CLARIFICATION] Stateless competitors have no national records and rankings, nor continental records and rankings.
- 2i+) [ADDITION] Although the competitor may pick up a stopwatch to view the current time (when they are not blindfolded), they must not start, stop, pause, or otherwise interact with the timekeeping of the stopwatch. Exception: The competitor may stop the stopwatch at the end of their attempt if the judge is not immediately available (see [Regulation A6a1](regulations:regulation:A6a1)).
- 2i++) [ADDITION] The organization team may provide the competitor an unofficial stopwatch for viewing the elapsed time (started together with the main stopwatch), in which case the competitor is not permitted to touch the official stopwatch. Exception: See the exception in [Guideline 2i+](guidelines:guideline:2i+).
- 2i+++) [REMINDER] Bluetooth puzzles are considered electronic devices.
- 2i++++) [CLARIFICATION] The competitor is considered to be using an electronic device only if they are putting it to a particular purpose.
- 2i+++++) [EXAMPLE] Examples that are not considered using an electronic device: moving a camera, flipping over a phone, wearing a smartwatch.
- 2i++++++) [EXAMPLE] Examples of using an electronic device: pressing a camera button, checking a message on a phone or smartwatch.
- 2i+++++++) [CLARIFICATION] Devices which were previously electronic but have their electronic parts removed may be permitted, at the discretion of the WCA Delegate.
- 2i1b+) [CLARIFICATION] This includes relevant devices which are switched off or disconnected.
- 2i2+) [CLARIFICATION] The competitor may hold or wear a camera or microphone anywhere, as long as the live feed of the camera is not visible to the competitor.
- 2j2+) [EXAMPLE] For example, if a competitor is disqualified from an event for failing to show up for the final round, their results from earlier rounds remain valid.
- 2j2++) [EXAMPLE] If the WCA Delegate disqualifies a competitor during their third attempt in a round, only the third attempt and all following attempts in that event are disqualified, even if the circumstances that originated the disqualification occurred prior to this attempt.
- 2k6+) [CLARIFICATION] WCA Delegates should only use their discretion to prevent competitors from being a severe detriment to the competition (e.g. wasting time and/or competition resources). Competitors should not be disqualified for a "poor" result when they are competing to the best of their abilities.
- 2n3+) [ADDITION] The competitor may escalate their dispute after the competition by following the process decribed in the [Disputes Motion](https://documents.worldcubeassociation.org/documents/motions/16.2024.1%20-%20Disputes.pdf).
- 2s+) [REMINDER] Special accommodations must be noted in the Delegate Report.
- 2s++) [EXAMPLE] Competitors whose circumstances (e.g. religion) do not allow them to compete on a specific date or time may be allowed to compete at a different time at the discretion of the WCA Delegate. The WCA Delegate should consider the availability of competition resources when attending such requests. This includes the possibility to provisionally compete in subsequent round(s) before the previous round(s) is (are) completed.
- 2s+++) [EXAMPLE] A competitor that can not use one of their hands to start the timer may receive assistance from the judge to start and stop the timer, or a competitor that cannot hear may receive their inspection warnings in a different way.
- 2s1+) [EXAMPLE] Examples of such accommodations include: a blind competitor using a second hand to feel the pieces in 3x3x3 One-Handed or using a second puzzle with special pieces during memorization phase in 3x3x3 Blindfolded.
- 2u1+) [ADDITION] The competitor may compete at the discretion of the WCA Delegate. The WCA Delegate must carefully consider the fairness of allowing it.


## <article-3><puzzles><puzzles> Article 3: Puzzles

- 3a+) [CLARIFICATION] Competitors may use puzzles of any reasonable size, at the discretion of the WCA Delegate.
- 3a++) [ADDITION] By default, a competitor should use the same puzzle for consecutive attempts in a speed solving round. A competitor may switch puzzles between attempts, at the discretion of the judge or WCA Delegate.
- 3a+++) [CLARIFICATION] Competitors may borrow puzzles from other competitors privately, to use in competition.
- 3a1+) [CLARIFICATION] Competitors may be disqualified if they do not have a puzzle ready to submit soon after they are called (e.g. if they planned to use a puzzle that another competitor is currently using, and therefore cannot submit a puzzle at the moment).
- 3d1b+) [CLARIFICATION] Patterns do not need to be present on every face, but only on faces where a distinct color cannot be found. Pieces must not have any features (e.g. textures, pattern irregularities) that significantly distinguish them from similar pieces.
- 3h+) [CLARIFICATION] Puzzles may be refined internally by sanding, lubrication, or modifications which improve stability (e.g. magnets).
- 3h++) [EXAMPLE] Examples of enhancements include: new moves are possible, normal moves are impossible, more pieces or faces are visible, colors on the backside of the puzzle are visible, moves are done automatically, or the puzzles have more/different solved states.
- 3h2++) [CLARIFICATION] "Stickerless" puzzles that significantly differ from most mass-produced "stickerless" puzzles are only permitted at the discretion of the WCA Delegate.
- 3h2a+) [ADDITION] Examples of transparent parts that do not reveal more information about the state of the puzzle: internal parts of the puzzle mechanism, transparent Clock cases.
- 3h4+) [CLARIFICATION] For Clock, visual modifications that enhance the ability to determine the orientation of the puzzle are permitted, as traditional puzzle designs already provide this information.
- 3j++) [EXAMPLE] There is a [Visual Guide](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1m6THsA8fXRN7QFM4ApJbm6eVODKGbMLx/view) available for [Regulation 3j](regulations:regulation:3j).
- 3k2+) [ADDITION] The WCA Delegate should not apply a listed exception if they believe the competitor tried to use a non-permitted puzzle on purpose.
- 3k2b+) [CLARIFICATION] If a non-permitted puzzle is found during the course of a 3x3x3 Multi-Blind attempt, the puzzle must not be exchanged or removed from the attempt and must be counted as unsolved if the entire attempt is not disqualified.
- 3k2b++) [EXAMPLE] Suppose the competitor attempts 10 puzzles and solves 8 successfully. If it is found that two solved puzzles and one unsolved puzzle are not permitted, the competitor is considered to have a result with 6 solved puzzles out of 10 (rather than DNF), at the discretion of the WCA Delegate.
- 3l+) [ADDITION] Logos may feature any reasonable design that does not give a conspicuous advantage (e.g. encoding information that could be used to cheat), and leave the colored part clearly recognizable. Unconventional logos are only permitted at the discretion of the WCA Delegate.
- 3l++) [CLARIFICATION] Logos are permitted for 3x3x3 Blindfolded, but not any other blindfolded events, including 3x3x3 Multi-Blind.
- 3l1+) [CLARIFICATION] On NxNxN puzzles, a center piece is any piece with a single colored part. For example, the 5x5x5 Cube has 9 center pieces on each face.


## <article-4><scrambling><scrambling> Article 4: Scrambling

- 4b+) [RECOMMENDATION] The WCA Delegate should generate sufficient scramble sequences for the entire competition ahead of time, including spare scramble sequences for extra attempts.
- 4b++) [REMINDER] If the WCA Delegate generates any additional scramble sequences during the competition, the scramble sequences must be saved.
- 4b1+) [REMINDER] The WCA Delegate must never re-generate any scramble sequences to replace other ones for the purpose of filtering. For example, it is not permitted to glance at the scramble sequences for a competition and generate the entire set again in order to generate "fairer" scramble sequences.
- 4b2+) [CLARIFICATION] In general, all official scramble sequences should be kept secret during the competition and published together after the end of the competition. In some cases (e.g. world records), the organization team may wish to release specific scramble sequences sooner after the end of a group.
- 4b2++) [ADDITION] Competition organizers should ensure that scramblers, scramble sequences, and partially/fully scrambled puzzles are visually isolated from competitors (see [Regulation A2c](regulations:regulation:A2c)). For example, the scramblers may be located behind a wall, or a sufficiently high divider (e.g. a cardboard divider placed around the sides of a table where the scramblers are seated) may be used so that competitors are not able to see puzzles as the scramblers apply scramble sequences.
- 4b4+) [CLARIFICATION] All attempts that have been started within the time frame follow the standard solving procedure (i.e. they are not stopped when the time frame of the relevant scramble sequence expires).
- 4d+) [CLARIFICATION] Some puzzles use standard color schemes, except that white is replaced with black. In this case, black is the darkest color and must not be treated as white.
- 4d++) [ADDITION] It is permitted for the puzzle to change its orientation when it is moved from the scrambler to the solving station, as long as no one is attempting to influence the randomness of the orientation (see [Regulation A2e1](regulations:regulation:A2e1)).
- 4g+) [RECOMMENDATION] After verifying the puzzle is scrambled correctly, the scrambler may pass the puzzle to another scrambler to verify. In this case, both scramblers should sign the scorecard.
- 4g1b+) [CLARIFICATION] For 5x5x5 Blindfolded, incorrect puzzle states must always be corrected.
- 4g1b++) [RECOMMENDATION] The WCA Delegate should use stronger discretion when determining whether or not incorrect puzzle states for 5x5x5 Cube need to be corrected.


## <article-5><puzzle-defects><puzzledefects> Article 5: Puzzle Defects

- 5b5+) [EXAMPLE] Examples of parts physically detached, resulting in a solved state: one 3x3x3 center cap, one big cube center piece, an inner piece of a big cube.
- 5b5++) [EXAMPLE] Examples of parts physically detached, resulting in a DNF: two 3x3x3 center caps, two big cube center pieces, a 3x3x3 edge piece, a 4x4x4 edge piece ("wing"), any combination of two pieces that both have colored parts.
- 5b5f+) [EXAMPLE] There is a [Visual Guide](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15XszaCGNvy3Dk6X6qERzZWZaDH1RH04z/view) available for [Regulation 5b5f](regulations:regulation:5b5f).
- 5b5f++) [EXAMPLE] A 4x4x4 Cube edge "wing" twisted on its spot is considered solved.
- 5b5f+++) [EXAMPLE] A corner affected by a corner twist is considered to be placed in a valid position, but such position does not render the piece solved.
- 5b5f++++) [CLARIFICATION] If there are multiple pieces partially detached or not fully placed, their final position is assessed one at a time. The piece that is closest to an open position is assessed first, and is then considered to occupy that position. This process is repeated until all partially detached or not fully placed pieces have been assessed.
- 5c+) [REMINDER] If a competitor has a puzzle defect, this does not grant them the right to an extra attempt.


## <article-7><environment><environment> Article 7: Environment

- 7f1a+) [CLARIFICATION] A full-size mat should have minimum dimensions of 30cm (left to right) by 25cm (front to back).
- 7h2+) [ADDITION] Competitors in a Competitor Waiting Area who are waiting between attempts should not be able to see the puzzles of the competitors on stage.


## <article-9><events><events> Article 9: Events

- 9b++) [ADDITION] Events other than those specified in [Regulation 9b](regulations:regulation:9b) may be held during a competition, but will be considered unofficial and therefore will not be included in the official results of the competition.
- 9b3b+) [CLARIFICATION] The "Mean of 3" statistic does not affect the competitor's ranking in a "Best of 3" round (which is based on the best result). The WCA recognizes it outside of the competition format.
- 9f1+) [EXAMPLE] If the timer displays 12.678 for an attempt, the original recorded time is 12.67 (drop any digit after a hundredth of a second). A judge may write the full-precision time on the score sheet (and keep the precision in the calculation of penalties), as long as the score taker truncates it for the official results.
- 9f2+) [ADDITION] For 3x3x3 Multi-Blind, the judge should record the number of puzzles solved, the number of puzzles attempted, and the final time. For example, if the competitor solves 3 cubes out of 5 attempted cubes in 40 minutes and 30 seconds, the judge should write down 3/5 40:30.
- 9f4+) [CLARIFICATION] The result of an attempt should be a DNF if the competitor began the attempt by indicating that they are ready (see [Regulation A3b2](regulations:regulation:A3b2)) but the attempt was disqualified.
- 9f5+) [CLARIFICATION] If the competitor did not qualify for an attempt (e.g. in a Cutoff Round), they have no result for the attempt.
- 9l1+) [CLARIFICATION] A DNF Result is generally considered a valid result. Extra attempts must not be given for using a non-permitted puzzle that is only found after the round is complete (see [Regulation 3k2a](regulations:regulation:3k2a)).
- 9l1++) [EXAMPLE] Examples of an invalid attempt: an attempt that was incorrectly scrambled, attempts where the results are no longer retrievable (e.g. a missing scorecard).
- 9p2+) [CLARIFICATION] Result refers to the single or average that determines the ranking of the corresponding round.
- 9p2b+) [ADDITION] If there are not enough competitors representing the relevant region to fill the reserved spaces, they are replaced with the best competitors representing any region.
- 9p2b++) [ADDITION] For a competition designated as both a World Championship and a Continental Championship and/or National Championship, this exception does not apply. For a competition designated as both a Continental Championship and a National Championship, spaces may only be reserved for competitors representing the relevant continent.
- 9p2b+++) [RECOMMENDATION] Any use of reserved spaces should be clearly announced before the competition.
- 9p3+) [CLARIFICATION] If a non-qualifying competitor would replace a qualifying competitor in this way, they may also withdraw, allowing the next best-ranked competitor to take their place.
- 9q+) [RECOMMENDATION] Events and rounds should have at least 2 competitors.
- 9t+) [EXPLANATION] Because of [9t1](regulations:regulation:9t1) and [9t2](regulations:regulation:9t2), rounds may look like they do not comply with [9p1](regulations:regulation:9p1), [9m1](regulations:regulation:9m1), [9m2](regulations:regulation:9m2) or [9m3](regulations:regulation:9m3). However, making changes to comply to these rules would affect innocent competitors, which is why the results must stay the same.
- 9t++) [ADDITION] If the change of results happens during the competition, this rule must also be applied. In that case, [9t1](regulations:regulation:9t1), [9t2](regulations:regulation:9t2) and [9t3](regulations:regulation:9t3) should also be followed, at the discretion of the WCA Delegate.
- 9t3+) [EXAMPLE] Suppose competitor A gets a 10.00 average and competitor B gets a 10.05 average in the first round of an event, such that competitor A advances to the final round but not B. If a score-taking mistake is discovered, and competitor B actually got a 9.95 average (and should have proceeded instead of A), competitor A keeps their result for the final round.
- 9u+) [ADDITION] For competitions with multiple physical locations (i.e. "3x3x3 Fewest Moves simultaneous competitions"), all the requirements must be met in every location to consider the competition as ended.
- 9u2+) [RECOMMENDATION] The WCA Delegate should announce the end of the competition (e.g. prior to the awards ceremony).
- 9u2b+) [ADDITION] The calendar date of the end of the competition is determined by the local time for the location in which the competition took place.


## <article-10><solved-state><solvedstate> Article 10: Solved State

- 10e1+) [CLARIFICATION] For Square-1, because of the shape-shifting property of the puzzle, the metric for misalignments defined in [Regulation 10f4](regulations:regulation:10f4) is different from the metric for the notation, used by the scramble program and defined in [Regulation 12c4](regulations:regulation:12c4).
- 10f+) [EXPLANATION] The misalignment limits are selected so that they provide a natural cutoff between one state of a puzzle (without penalty) and a state one move away.
- 10f4+) [CLARIFICATION] When counting the moves in case of a misalignment at the end of a solve, X and Y are considered separately. Example: (5, 1) is considered one misalignment, (5, 5) is considered two misalignments.
- 10h1+) [ADDITION] The solved state of Clock is not affected by loose or popped pin caps.


## <article-11><incidents><incidents> Article 11: Incidents

- 11e+) [CLARIFICATION] Since an appeal is not guaranteed to be successful, the competitor may choose to keep the timer running while appealing it, and resume the solve when appropriate.
- 11e++) [RECOMMENDATION] The WCA Delegate should record the reason(s) for the extra attempt (e.g. on the back of the score sheet).
- 11e+++) [RECOMMENDATION] The WCA Delegate should use stronger discretion when granting an extra attempt after the solve is finished. The extra attempt should be granted only in exceptional circumstances.
- 11e++++) [REMINDER] The attempt is finished after the competitor checks the recorded result and signs on the score sheet (see [Regulation A7c](regulations:regulation:A7c)).
- 11e+++++) [ADDITION] If the WCA Delegate does not have time to investigate this claim during the competition, they should grant the competitor a provisional extra.
- 11e++++++) [ADDITION] An extra attempt is considered to be done at the time that the original solve happened. For example, if a round was originally scheduled for January 21st, and a competitor receives an extra on January 22nd, the extra solve is considered to be done on January 21st.
- 11e+++++++) [RECOMMENDATION] If an extra attempt is given for a round after a subsequent round has finished, and the extra attempt causes the competitor to advance to the next round, the competitor should not compete in the subsequent round, at the discretion of the WCA Delegate.
- 11e1+) [REMINDER] The extra attempt must be scrambled using an unmodified scramble sequence generated by an official scramble program (see [Regulation 4f](regulations:regulation:4f), [Guideline 4f+](guidelines:guideline:4f+)).
- 11e2+) [ADDITION] If an extra attempt itself leads to an additional extra attempt, the competitor should keep doing extra attempts until there is a valid extra attempt to replace the original regularly numbered attempt.
- 11e2++) [EXAMPLE] Suppose a competitor has 5 regularly numbered attempts, and #2 leads to extra attempts. The competitor should do extra attempts until there is a valid extra attempt to replace #2. Suppose later another attempt leads to extra attempts, the competitor should proceed in a similar way as for #2.
- 11f1+) [RECOMMENDATION] The WCA Regulations Committee should be consulted if slow-motion or frame-by-frame analysis are required.
- 11i1+) [RECOMMENDATION] Competitors expected to meet these criteria should have their scrambles checked by a second scrambler before being sent out (see [Guideline 4g+](guidelines:guideline:4g+)).
- 11i2+) [RECOMMENDATION] If the WCA Delegate is unsure whether or not the incorrect scramble provided a significantly less fair outcome than the original scramble, a provisional extra attempt should be granted.
- 11i2++) [REMINDER] Although individual results achieved on incorrectly scrambled puzzles may be allowed to stand, the WCA Delegate must ensure that incorrect scrambles do not become common.
- 11j3+) [REMINDER] The scramble sequence used for the extra attempt must not be obtained from a previous group.


## <article-12><notation><notation> Article 12: Notation

- 12a2+) [CLARIFICATION] For example, both Rw and 2Rw are valid notation for the same physical move for the 3x3x3 Cube. 1Rw is not valid notation for any NxNxN Cube, and 3Rw is not valid notation for the 2x2x2 Cube or the 3x3x3 Cube (but 3Rw is valid notation for the 4x4x4 Cube and larger NxNxN Cubes).
- 12g3+) [REMINDER] As clock scramble sequences end with an X+ or X- move, all pins are pushed down once the scramble sequence has been fully applied.
- 12i+) [CLARIFICATION] Rotations do not change the puzzle state.


## <article-A><speedsolving><speedsolving> Article A: Speed Solving

- A1a+) [CLARIFICATION] If both limits are applied, the time limit per attempt must not be greater than the cumulative time limit.
- A1a2+) [ADDITION] In case of a cumulative time limit, the judge records the original recorded time for a DNF on the score sheet in parentheses, e.g. "DNF (1:02.27)".
- A1a2++) [EXAMPLE] If a round has only a cumulative time limit of 30 minutes and the competitor's results of the first two attempts are 6:00 and DNF (10:00), then the time limit for the third attempt is 30:00 - 6:00 - 10:00 = 14:00. For this particular example, note that only the final result for an attempt counts. Therefore, a third attempt with an original recorded time of 13:59 without penalties meets the time limit because the final result is 13:59 (see [Regulation 9f2](regulations:regulation:9f2)), while a third attempt with a result of 13:59 + 2 = 14:01 does not meet the time limit.
- A1a2+++) [ADDITION] If the result from an attempt is unavailable (e.g. the timer was reset), the judge should consult the WCA Delegate and make an estimate of the elapsed time for the attempt. This estimate counts towards the time limit, but must not be used as the basis of an official result for the individual attempt.
- A1a2++++) [EXAMPLE] If a round has a cumulative time limit of 20 minutes and a time limit of 8 minutes, and the competitor's results of the first two attempts are 7:00 and 7:30, then the time limit for the third attempt is the lower time of 5:30 (calculated as 20:00 - 7:00 - 7:30) and 8:00, i.e. 5:30.
- A1a2+++++) [CLARIFICATION] If a competitor reaches a cumulative time limit, the result for each of their remaining attempts in the round is recorded as DNS (Did Not Start).
- A1a2++++++) [CLARIFICATION] If a cumulative time limit applies to a combination of rounds for different events, the order in which attempts are done is the order in which those attempts count towards the cumulative time limit.
- A1a3+) [REMINDER] The organization team and the WCA Delegate must be mindful that time limits influence the strategies of the competitors (e.g. rushing the first two attempts in hopes of meeting a cutoff in a cutoff round), and that changing time limits after the start of the round can disadvantage some competitors unfairly.
- A1a4+) [REMINDER] If a competitor has accidentally been permitted to exceed the time limit, the time limit must be enforced retroactively, and the judge, competitor, and WCA Delegate should be informed (see [Regulation 1g2](regulations:regulation:1g2)). Judges must always be aware of the time limit for a current attempt (which might depend on previous attempts, in the case of a cumulative time limit).
- A2a3+) [REMINDER] Competitors should not be permitted to view the scramble sequences for their own group even after having completed all their attempts, unless permission has been granted by the WCA Delegate (see [Guideline 4b2+](guidelines:guideline:4b2+)).
- A2c1+) [REMINDER] In the past, score sheets have been used to cover puzzles while leaving some sides exposed. This is no longer permitted.
- A2c2+) [REMINDER] If the competitor accidentally views a scramble they have not yet received, the competitor must not receive that scramble for their own attempt and an extra attempt must be granted instead.
- A2d1+) [ADDITION] If the scramble signature is found to be missing before an attempt, the puzzle should immediately be returned to a scrambler for verification and a corresponding signature.
- A2d1++) [ADDITION] An attempt must not be disqualified solely due to a missing scramble signature. If a scramble signature is missing after the beginning of an attempt, the judge must allow the attempt to continue (if it is still in progress) and the WCA Delegate should allow the result to be kept.
- A2d1+++) [REMINDER] Although the WCA Delegate may allow several individual attempts with missing scramble signatures to count, they should ensure that missing scramble signatures do not become common.
- A3c1+) [CLARIFICATION] For Clock, the competitor may change the state of the pins during inspection (see [Regulation 12i1](regulations:regulation:12i1)).
- A3c3+) [CLARIFICATION] The competitor may reset the timer before/during the inspection phase if the judge accidentally neglected to do so. However, it is the responsibility of the judge to make sure the timer has been reset (see [Regulation A3b](regulations:regulation:A3b)). If the competitor accidentally tries to start the solve with a timer that the judge did not reset (i.e. the competitor performs inspection, places hands on the Stackmat timer for a reasonable length of time, assumes that the timer will start normally, and starts to operate the puzzle), the attempt should be replaced by an extra attempt, at the discretion of the WCA Delegate.
- A3c3++) [CLARIFICATION] The competitor cannot "test" or "restart" the timer during inspection, since inspection ends once the competitor starts the solve (see [Regulation A4d](regulations:regulation:A4d)). If the competitor stops the timer after they have started it for the first time, this is considered stopping the solve (see [Regulation A6](regulations:regulation:A6)), even if they do so within 15 seconds of starting inspection.
- A3c4+) [CLARIFICATION] If the use of a thin object inside the puzzle has been enforced, the judge must not remove the object on behalf of the competitor.
- A3c4++) [CLARIFICATION] The competitor may remove the object during the solve, if they did not do it during the inspection (e.g. they forgot).
- A4d1+) [CLARIFICATION] If the inspection took exactly 15 seconds (i.e. 15.00), the time penalty (+2 seconds) must be applied.
- A4d2+) [CLARIFICATION] If the inspection took exactly 17 seconds (i.e. 17.00), the attempt must be disqualified (DNF).
- A5b+) [CLARIFICATION] While inspecting or solving the puzzle, the competitor may touch the puzzle with any part of their body. Exception: 3x3x3 One-Handed (see [Regulation C1b](regulations:regulation:C1b)).
- A5b++) [CLARIFICATION] If a part of the competitor's puzzle is popped out or detached (see [Regulation 5a](regulations:regulation:5a)), the competitor must not ask for assistance retrieving or locating the part and the judge should attempt to prevent others from assisting. If someone picks up a popped part for the competitor, the judge or competitor may ask them to place it on the solving station and not to assist any further.
- A5b+++) [CLARIFICATION] The WCA Delegate should not grant the competitor an extra attempt solely based on someone picking up a popped or detached part of the competitor's puzzle.
- A6b1+) [EXPLANATION] The arbitrary value of 0.06 seconds was chosen to accommodate concerns about Stackmat timer malfunctions.
- A6e+) [CLARIFICATION] If the puzzle falls into the lap of the competitor after stopping the timer, this is considered touching the puzzle.
- A6e++) [CLARIFICATION] If [Regulation A6c](regulations:regulation:A6c) is used to penalize an attempt, the penalties in [Regulation A6e](regulations:regulation:A6e) should only be applied if the competitor releases the puzzle and touches it again before the judge inspects it.
- A7c+) [ADDITION] If a result signed by a competitor is found to be incomplete or unreadable, it should be interpreted the worst reasonable way (e.g. "1:05" will be considered 1:05.99, "25.X3" will be considered 25.73 if X could be either a 1 or a 7). Given that the Stackmat timer displays a time of X:0Y.ss as X:Y.ss, a missing tens digit should be considered more likely than a missing ones digit (e.g. "1:2.27" will be considered 1:02.27). The judge who signed an ambiguous result may be requested to clarify it, at the discretion of the score taker.
- A7c6+) [EXAMPLE] Examples of signatures that identify the competitor: Name, initials, WCA ID, competition registrant ID, a reasonable nickname.
- A7c6++) [EXPLANATION] A competition registrant ID is an identifier (e.g. a number) assigned to a competitor for the competition. Some competitions use this to keep track of score sheets and enter results.
- A7c6+++) [RECOMMENDATION] The organization team may request competitors to sign with one particular method of identification (e.g. competition registrant ID), but competitors should not be disqualified for using a different method when signing.
- A7c6++++) [ADDITION] Competitors should use the same signature when they are judging and/or scrambling at the competition.
- A7g+) [EXAMPLE] Examples of incidents that could grant a competitor an extra attempt due to inexperience: not waiting for the green light, improperly starting or stopping the timer, going over inspection time due to misunderstanding how to start a solve, or other procedural time penalties.
- A7g++) [CLARIFICATION] Individual penalties cannot be waived. A full extra attempt must be granted.
- A7g+++) [RECOMMENDATION] The WCA Delegate should use stronger discretion when granting more than one extra attempt to the same competitor. If more than one extra attempt is granted, it should be for a different type of incident. Example: if the WCA Delegate already awarded an extra attempt for a competitor who did not wait long enough for the green light, they should not award another extra attempt if that competitor fails to wait long enough for the green light again.
- A7g++++) [CLARIFICATION] A competitor may be considered inexperienced if they are a new competitor, it is their first time competing in a specific event, or they have not competed in a specific event for a significant period of time. The inexperience must be related to the incident.


## <article-B><blindfolded><blindfoldedsolving> Article B: Blindfolded Solving

- B1+) [REMINDER] The competitor must use a puzzle without textures, markings, or other features that distinguish similar pieces (see [Regulation 3k](regulations:regulation:3k)). This should be given special attention for Blindfolded Solving. Exception: For 3x3x3 Blindfolded, the puzzle may have any logos permitted by [Regulation 3l](regulations:regulation:3l).
- B1b+) [RECOMMENDATION] Blindfolds should be checked by the WCA Delegate before use in the competition.
- B2d+) [ADDITION] By default, the competitor starts the solve the first time that they start the timer after the judge has indicated that they are ready (see [Regulation B2a](regulations:regulation:B2a)). If they want to check that the timer is in working order, they must (ask and) receive confirmation from the judge each time before starting/resetting the timer during this phase. Penalty for starting and resetting a timer without confirmation from the judge: disqualification of the attempt (DNF).
- B2f+) [CLARIFICATION] Since the competitor starts the solve by lifting the cover, penalties for starting the timer and for touching the cover while starting the attempt do not apply (see [Regulation B2b](regulations:regulation:B2b) and [Regulation B2c](regulations:regulation:B2c)).
- B4c++) [ADDITION] If the judge forgot to put a sight blocker and the WCA Delegate does not suspect that the competitor intentionally violated any WCA Regulations, the original attempt may stand.
- B4d+) [CLARIFICATION] For 3x3x3 Blindfolded, competitors are permitted to determine the location of a permitted logo (see [Regulation 3l](regulations:regulation:3l)) by touch during the blindfolded phase. 


## <article-C><one-handed><onehandedsolving> Article C: One-Handed Solving

- C1b+) [CLARIFICATION] The competitor may use both hands during inspection.
- C1b++) [CLARIFICATION] The competitor is not required to use the same solving hand for different attempts of the same round.


## <article-E><fewest-moves><fewestmovessolving> Article E: Fewest Moves Solving

- E2a1+) [RECOMMENDATION] If a judge finds a submitted solution that does not appear to have information to identify the attempt, they should check both sides of the paper.
- E2b+) [CLARIFICATION] A competitor may choose to stop an attempt early by handing in a solution before the time limit.
- E2c+) [CLARIFICATION] Although the judge may provide a standard sheet for competitors to submit solutions, a competitor may submit a solution on a different piece of paper. (Note that the piece of paper must come from the judge, according to [Regulation E3a](regulations:regulation:E3a).)
- E2c1+++) [EXPLANATION] The competitor is not required to write the competition name, round, and/or attempt number on their submitted paper, but may wish to do so in order to help the organization team keep track of submitted solutions.
- E2c2+) [EXAMPLE] Examples that are not considered a single unambiguous move sequence: multiple solution sequences without exactly one clearly indicated solution, a solution with ambiguous symbols (e.g. a letter that looks similar to "B" and "R" but is not clearly one or the other), a solution with stars or arrows indicating moves to be performed out of written order (e.g. "insertions" that are not written in-line with the rest of the move sequence, "pre-moves" that are not incorporated into the move sequence using valid notation), a move sequence that is not written out roughly as a series of lines in reading order, any arrangement of symbols that cannot be interpreted as an unambiguous move sequence. Exceptions to the examples above: small typographic corrections (e.g. blacking out moves and writing moves above that are clearly meant to replace them, moves written in subscript or superscript to fit between other moves).
- E2c2++) [REMINDER] In the past, bracket notations (e.g. [r] or [u2]) were permitted for Fewest Moves. Only rotations based on x, y, or z are permitted now (see [Regulation 12a4a](regulations:regulation:12a4a)).
- E2c3+) [CLARIFICATION] If a move is not clearly blacked out/scribbled out and it is not clear whether the move is part of the solution, the judge should consider it an ambiguous move sequence (see [Regulation E2c2](regulations:regulation:E2c2) and [Guideline E2c2+](guidelines:guideline:E2c2+)).
- E2c4+) [EXAMPLE] Examples of interpreting symbols or combinations of symbols that are not defined in [Regulation 12a](regulations:regulation:12a): [x] should be interpreted as x. (R * U', * = F2) should be interpreted as R U' F2. (R U)' should be interpreted as R U'. R++ should be interpreted as R. R3' is not permitted.
- E2c4++) [ADDITION] Moves with both an apostrophe and a 2 should be interpreted as if there were no apostrophe (e.g. R2' should be interpreted as R2).
- E2c6+) [EXAMPLE] Y should be interpreted as y. UW, uw, and uW should be interpreted as Uw. r should be interpreted as R, not Rw.
- E2e+) [CLARIFICATION] Competitors must not derive solutions from any part of the scramble sequence, and solutions should not share significant parts with the inverse scramble sequence.
- E2e++) [EXAMPLE] Example of solutions that should result in a disqualification of the attempt (DNF): solutions beginning with the same 4 or more moves as the inverse scramble sequence.
- E3b+) [CLARIFICATION] Puzzles do not need to be solved at the start of the attempt.
- E3d+) [CLARIFICATION] Any stopwatch or watch used by a competitor must not have any functions that would help the competitor find a solution.
- E3d++) [CLARIFICATION] Competitors should not consider a personal stopwatch or watch as the official time, and must submit their solution when the judge calls "STOP".


## <article-H><multiple-blindfolded><multipleblindfoldedsolving> Article H: Multi-Blind Solving

- H1+) [ADDITION] If a puzzle with a duplicate scramble is found during an attempt, the puzzle may be re-scrambled using a different scramble sequence, at the discretion of the WCA Delegate.
- H1b+) [ADDITION] A competitor may join a Multi-Blind attempt that is already in progress, at the discretion of the WCA Delegate. In this case, their time limit is the time remaining (i.e. they must finish when other competitors reach their time limit). Exception: a competitor must not be permitted to join a Multi-Blind attempt if any competitor has finished their attempt already, or if there is any other risk that information about the scramble may have become known to the competitor who wishes to join.
- H1b1+) [REMINDER] The attempt is not disqualified for reaching the time limit, due to exceptions for 3x3x3 Multi-Blind (see [Regulation A1a4](regulations:regulation:A1a4) and [Regulation A1a5](regulations:regulation:A1a5)).
- H1b1++) [ADDITION] The judge may permit the competitor to continue the attempt unofficially, but the attempt must be stopped and judged first, in full accordance with the Regulations.
- H1d+) [EXAMPLE] Example: Suppose a competitor attempts 10 cubes, stops the solve with a time of 59:57, and has two time penalties. The time of the final result is 59:57 + 2*2 = 60:01 (also see [Regulation A1a5](regulations:regulation:A1a5)).
- H1d++) [EXAMPLE] Example: Suppose a competitor attempts 10 cubes, the judge stops the competitor at 60 minutes, and the attempt has two time penalties. The time of the final result is 60:00 + 2*2 = 60:04.
